# Unexpected Behavior Using @apply Directive in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using the `@apply` directive in Tailwind CSS. The `@apply` directive allows you to reuse sets of utility classes, but in certain situations, combining it with other classes can lead to unexpected styling results.

## Bug Description
The bug involves unexpected behavior when using `@apply` in conjunction with other utility classes. Sometimes the expected styles won't be applied correctly, leading to inconsistencies in the UI.  This might be particularly tricky to debug due to its subtle nature.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies.
3. Run a local server or open `index.html` in a browser.
4. Observe the unexpected styling, showing how the `@apply` directive doesn't fully work as expected.

## Solution
Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for a possible solution.  The solution in many cases involves restructuring CSS or utility class application to resolve the conflict.

## Note
This is a rather uncommon bug, often related to the complexity of CSS rules involved. Understanding Tailwind's specificity rules and how `@apply` interacts with them is key to avoidance.
